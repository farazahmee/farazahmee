What is Splunk?
Transfrom Machine data into valuable realtime insights which is available in the form of custom Dashboard.
It is a tool to analyze the machine data. Machine data will help us to alert the system admins about any security issue and system failure. Analyze the machine data is also help 
us to improve machine functionality.
Analyze machine data is not a simple task, so how we do that  So u r working in an organisation as a system admin, and data can be generated from different system sources
such as:  Network devices, sensors, cloud devices, Internet of things and mobiles devices.
Data generated from this resoucres will be in the form of unstructured data.

 Let say in this image we have a system failure and its very difficult to find which step is system failure. So the data is unstructured format 
 So in this case we need a tool to understand machine data that identify the where the hardware and software has failed. 
 Splunk is a tool which the machine data is processed to extract data onto human readable format.that is help us to analyze the problem.
 PRIMARY COMPONENETS:
 1- Forwarder: is responsible to collecting the data and forward into other splunk instance and indexers
 2- indexers: helps us store and index the data howover we cant access the data from indexers  need to have
 3- Search heads: help us to analyze & visualize to report the data
 Splunk help us users to leverage the machine data in analyzing the **system performance** identify the **failure condition in systems**
 monitoring the **business matrix** , **investigate the data** creating dashboard storing the data for future referneces.
Data stored in machines in the form of logs, databases, views, API's. Extract data using SPL Search processing language, all data in the machines stored in the form of event.

**Benefits of Splunk**
1- input the data in any form
2- splunk searches term with the help of SPL language
3- data directly store in splunk file sys
4- not a sinple point of failure is encountered
